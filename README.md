# My-NLP-Project: Generating New NFT Traits on the Most Valuable NFT Collection; Comparing LSTMâ€™s

Please see the link to the respository: https://github.com/22040102/My-NLP-Project



Project repository contains:

The 'NLP Project-NFTs-traits-original-Copy2.ipynb' notebook, which is the main aspect of the project comparing two types of LSTM's on small datasets associated to traits from one of the most valuable NFT collections on OpenSea. 


There are also extensions I wanted to try out. Having found that 'Textgenrrn' was giving me some results, the following notebooks are an extension with this LSTM with image generation. Prompts were used accordingly from the language generation from Textgenrnn.  

- 'NLP-Project-cryptopunks-textgenrrn-extn.ipynb' is an extension of the project using the 'Cryptopunks' collection.
- 'NLP-Project-pudgypenguins-textgenrrn-extn.ipynb' is an extension of the project using the 'Pudgy Penguins' collection.
