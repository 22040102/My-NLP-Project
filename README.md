# My-NLP-Project: Generating New NFT Traits on the Most Valuable NFT Collection; Comparing LSTMâ€™s

Project repository contains:

The 'NLP Project-NFTs-traits-original-Copy2.ipynb' notebook, which is the main aspect of the project. 

There are also extensions I wanted to try out. Having found that 'Textgenrrn' was giving me some results, the following notebooks are an extension with this LSTM. 

'NLP-Project-cryptopunks-textgenrrn-extn.ipynb' is an extension of the project work using the 'Cryptopunks' collection.
'NLP-Project-pudgypenguins-textgenrrn-extn.ipynb' is an extension of the project work using the 'Pudgy Penguins' collection.
